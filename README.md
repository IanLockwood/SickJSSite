# SickJSSite
My personal website - I'll be outfitting it with tons of fun JS/JQ

## FYI
I'll be starting with a Start Bootstrap Template called [Freelancer](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-freelancer) and I have to give credit where credit is due, but truthfully I'm just grabbing it for the frame, easy setup and contact form. Very soon the template will be very unrecognizable.
